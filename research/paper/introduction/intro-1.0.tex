\section{Introduction} 

The search for alternate energy sources which could be categorised  under the ``green" label has become an important area of research in the modern word. Solar, wind power and wave power are some of the examples of these sources.  Recently, a new branch of research has been developing to extract energy from flow induced vibrations(\cite{Bernitsas2008a-concept}). It has been hypothesized that this technique may work efficiently in areas where regular turbines cannot. 

An elastically mounted slender structure such as cylinders which  are susceptible to flow-induced vibrations has the potential for energy extraction. With regards to a slender bodies, two common types of   flow induced vibrations are Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV) and aeroelastic galloping. Significant research has been carried out by Bernitsas and his team on extracting useful energy from VIV. Some of their significant work includes investigating the influence  of physical parameters such as mass ratio, Reynolds number, mechanical properties (\cite{Raghavan2010a} , \cite{Lee2011b}) and influence of proximity to solid boundary (\cite{Raghavan2009}). However, the possibility of extracting energy using aeroelastic galloping has not been thoroughly investigated. Some theoretical work was carried out by (\cite{Barrero-Gil2010a}). Utilizing galloping may be a more viable method to harness energy from flow induced vibrations as it is not bounded by a narrow ``lock-in" range of reduced velocities(\ustar). This study further explores the possibility of harnessing energy from flow induced vibrations using aeroelastic galloping.

According to \cite{Paidoussis2010}, \cite{Glauert1919} has provided a criterion for galloping by considering the auto-rotation of an aerofoil.  \cite{DenHartog1956}  has provided a theoretical explanation for galloping for iced electric transmission lines. A weakly non-linear theoretical aeroelastic model to predict the response of galloping was developed by \cite{Parkinson1964} based on the quasi-steady state (QSS) theory. Experimental lift and drag data on a fixed square prism at different angles of attack were used as an input for the theoretical model. It essentially used a curve fit of the transverse force to predict the galloping response. The study managed to achieve a good agreement with experimental data. The QSS model equation when solved analytically using sinusoidal solution method cannot predict cases with low mass ratios. \cite{Joly2012} have observed that finite element simulations shows a sudden change in amplitudes  below a critical values of the mass ratio. The Parkinson's equation when modified to account for the vortex shedding and and solved numerically, to predict the reduced amplitude at low mass ratios to the point where galloping is no longer present. \cite{Barrero-Gil2010a} have investigated the possibility of extracting power from vibrations caused by galloping using the quasi-steady state model. In the conclusions of that paper it was pointed out that in order to obtain a high power to area ratio, the mass-damping ($m^*\zeta$) parameter should be kept low. He studied the influence of the characteristics of the $C_y$ curve on maximum power output.
