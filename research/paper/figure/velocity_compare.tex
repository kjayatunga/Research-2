  \caption{Time histories of velocity at two different $\zeta$ and $U^*$ which produce the same mean power ($1.2\times10^{-3}$). Data presented in (a) are at $\ustar=60$, $\zeta=0.075$ and (b) are at $\ustar=165$, $\zeta=0.175$. Both data sets were obtained using Quasi-steady state assumption using input $C_y$ parameters at $Re=165$. Shedding is evident in both signals as a high frequency fluctuation but the amplitude of the slower fluctuations remains constant in both cases.}
